# Checkers Game - Java Implementation

A console-based Checkers game implemented in Java, allowing two players to take turns making moves. The game validates moves, handles piece jumps, and promotes pieces to kings upon reaching the opposite end of the board.

## Features
- **Turn-based gameplay**: Alternate between Black (`b`) and White (`w`) pieces.
- **Move validation**: Ensures moves follow Checkers rules (diagonal movement, mandatory jumps).
- **Jump mechanics**: Supports capturing opponent pieces using `x` (e.g., `5x9`).
- **King promotion**: Promotes pieces to kings (`B` or `W`) when reaching the opponent's end row.
- **Visual board**: Prints the updated board state after each move.
- **Input validation**: Prevents invalid moves and prompts for retries.
- **Cross-platform**: Runs on any system with Java 18+.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 18 or later
- Terminal or IDE (IntelliJ recommended)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repository-url]
   cd checkers-game
Compile and run (via terminal):

bash
Copy
javac project.java
java project
For IntelliJ users: Import the project using the finalproject.iml file.

Game Rules
Starting Player: Choose Black/B or White/W when prompted.

Move Input:

Normal move: Enter positions as start-end (e.g., 9-13).

Jump move: Use x to capture (e.g., 5x9 for a single jump).
